# SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

The Salary Calculator does the following:
- Takes in employee data and displays it as a new entry on the Employee table. 
- Once the new employee entry is displayed, it calculates the total monthly cost to pay all employees.
- If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, an alert dialog will inform the user that they have exceeded the monthly budget.
- When the user presses the delete button, it removes the entry and updates the total monthly cost.
